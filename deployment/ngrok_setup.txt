# Heart Disease Project - Ngrok Deployment Instructions

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Open a terminal in the project directory and start the Streamlit app:
   cd ui
   streamlit run app.py

3. When the app runs, the public Ngrok URL will automatically be generated and displayed in the sidebar:
   Public app URL: https://abcd-1234.ngrok-free.app

4. Open that public URL in a browser to access the app remotely.

# Notes:
- If you get an ngrok session error (ERR_NGROK_108), terminate any previous ngrok processes and restart the app.
- Your Ngrok authtoken must be set up if required by your account. Run:
  ngrok authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN
